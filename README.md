# Artificial Intelligence for Hotel Customer Experience Analysis

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Artificial Intelligence for Hotel Customer Experience Analysis" project. In this project, we delve into a hotel dataset containing valuable insights into the La Veranda hotel, a 3-star establishment nestled in the beautiful city of Larnaca, Cyprus. The dataset comprises 1523 rows and 11 columns, offering a comprehensive view of the hotel's operations and customer interactions.

**La Veranda Hotel Overview**:
La Veranda hotel is situated in a prime location, surrounded by serene residential areas, and within walking distance of a picturesque beach and convenient supermarkets. This tranquil setting provides the perfect backdrop for a relaxing vacation. The hotel boasts elegantly decorated rooms and suites equipped with modern amenities, making it an ideal destination for families, friends, and couples seeking a peaceful and rejuvenating retreat in a stunning natural environment.

## Problem Statement

The primary goal of this project is to gain a deep understanding of customer behavior and their overall experience at La Veranda hotel. By leveraging artificial intelligence and data-driven techniques, we aim to:

- Analyze customer reviews and feedback to uncover patterns and sentiments.
- Identify areas of improvement and prioritize enhancements to enhance guest satisfaction.
- Utilize machine learning models for predictive analysis and personalized recommendations.
- Develop strategies for optimizing hotel operations, marketing, and customer engagement based on AI-driven insights.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains a wealth of information related to the hotel, including guest reviews, ratings, booking details, and more. It serves as the foundation for our AI-driven analysis and decision-making.

## Methodology

Our approach involves the utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to extract valuable insights from the dataset. We will employ natural language processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis of customer reviews, build recommendation systems, and apply predictive analytics to forecast future trends in hotel occupancy and guest preferences.
